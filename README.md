Hello, my name is Geancarlo.

I'm a front-end developer with over a decade of experience and a degree in design. My main skills involve HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Over the years, I have worked with several frameworks and libraries, such as Laravel, Wordpress, Bootstrap, VueJS, React and others. I also played the role of manager of the developer team at the company where I worked for around 15 years.

I have ease in team communication and am an enthusiast of semantic code, SEO, UX, performance and responsiveness.
