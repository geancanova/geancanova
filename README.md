Hello, I'm Geancarlo.

I'm a front-end developer with over a decade of experience and background in design.

My skills involve HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Over the years, I've worked with several frameworks and libraries, such as Laravel, Wordpress, Bootstrap, VueJS, React and others. Also playing the role of manager of the developer team at the company where I worked for 15 years.

I have ease of communication with the team and I am an enthusiast of semantic code, SEO, performance and responsiveness. Also working together with designers suggesting UX solutions for applications.
